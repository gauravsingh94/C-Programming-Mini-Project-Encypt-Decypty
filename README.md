Step1 : Suppose the input file contain this things



Step2: Now we have to Encrypt this file , So we run the code file.














Step 3 : After running this file and giving the input.txt file as input it will encrypt the input.txt in the output.txt file


Step 4: Encypted File will look like this:















Part 2 : Steps for Decrypting our file.

Step 1: Suppose this is a file and we have to decrypt it.
 Step 2: Now we will run the code in the terminal.













Step 5: Now this file will decrypt successfully in the output file.
